# Artist Guide

This guide is intended for artists and programmers who are interested in how content can be generated for the PlayCanvas runtime.

## PlayCanvas Asset Tools

The Asset Tools are a set of programs that can:

* Convert FBX files into PlayCanvas-friendly format.
* Send scenes directly from 3DS Max to the PlayCanvas runtime in the browser for rapid iteration.

## System Requirements

* Microsoft Windows XP SP2, Windows Vista or Windows 7.
* Autodesk 3DS Max 2010 or greater.
* Autodesk Maya 2010 or greater.
* FBX plugin 2010.2.1 or greater.
* Google Chrome 12.0.xxx.xx or greater.
* Latest video driver for your graphics card. Check by visiting amd.com or nvidia.com (or the web site of your card manufacturer). If your graphics card driver is deemed ‘too old’ by Chrome, 3D rendering will be disabled. You can check this status by visiting the URL about:gpu in Google Chrome and verifying the line: ‘WebGL: Hardware accelerated’.

## Known Issues

All meshes created in 3DS Max must have a material assigned for them to export properly.
Google Chrome is currently a little flaky when being launched from 3DS Max. It is recommended that you close your Visualizer tab once you have finished visualizing your scene so that only one instance is running the next time you invoke Visualizer.
The PlayCanvas Asset Tools uninstaller does not delete temporary files creating by the tools. These can be found in C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\PlayCanvas on Windows Vista and Windows 7.  On Windows XP, these are found at C:\Documents and Settings\<USERNAME>\Local Settings\Application Data\PlayCanvas. All files found here can be safely deleted at any time.

## Installing the PlayCanvas Asset Tools

* Download playcanvas-asset-tools-x.x.x.msi.
* Run the installer and step through it as shown below:

[TODO]

### Install the PlayCanvas 3DS Max Script

This step is only necessary if you have 3DS Max installed and you want to integrate the PlayCanvas Visualizer into Max’s menu.

Locate the file playcanvas.ms in <PLAYCANVAS_INSTALL_DIR>\tools\3dsmax and copy this to the stdplugins\stdscripts folder in your 3DS Max install.

### Install the PlayCanvas Maya Script

This step is only necessary if you have Maya installed and you want to integrate the PlayCanvas Visualizer into Maya’s menu.

Locate the files playcanvas.py and userSetup.py in <PLAYCANVAS_INSTALL_DIR>\tools\maya and copy them to the <YOUR_USER_PROFILE>\Documents\Maya\scripts folder. If you already have a userSetup.py file (that executes Python statements every time you start Maya), you simply need to merge the contents of the PlayCanvas file into your existing file.

## Visualizer

The PlayCanvas Visualizer is useful for previewing individual models and animations. Naturally, it runs in the browser and appears as follows:

[TODO]

It is possible to invoke Visualizer directly from the modelling application, allowing fast iteration of PlayCanvas content generation. This guide will step you through the running and operation of Visualizer.

### Running the PlayCanvas Visualizer

Once you have installed the PlayCanvas Asset Tools, you are almost ready to Visualize your first scene from 3DS Max or Maya. But first…

### Starting the Visualizer HTTP Server

Run the ‘Start Visualizer Server’ shortcut in the PlayCanvas program group in the Start Menu. This will invoke a DOS box running a local HTTP server which serves the Visualizer web application and scenes exported from 3DS Max to the web browser. The server will continue to run until the DOS box is forcibly closed. But you must ensure it is running as long as you want 3DS Max or Maya to be sending scenes to Visualizer.

### Visualizing your First Scene

Now you should be ready to view your first scene in the PlayCanvas Visualizer! Follow the steps below to view a simple Max object in the browser:

* Start 3DS Max or Maya. You will notice there should now be a menu in the main menu bar called PlayCanvas. There is a single menu item under the PlayCanvas menu: Visualizer.
* Create a polygon mesh object near the world space origin.
* If you are running 3DS Max, assign a material to the object. Note that this step is important, since PlayCanvas requires all meshes to have a material assigned.
* Select the PlayCanvas Visualizer menu item.

These steps are executed in the video below:

[TODO]

### Visualizer Controls

To navigate the camera in the PlayCanvas Visualizer, use the following controls:

* Mouse Wheel: Dolly the camera backwards and forwards.
* ALT+Left Mouse Button: Orbit the camera.
* ALT+Middle Mouse Button: Pan the camera.

## Building Content in 3DS Max

PlayCanvas sucks in content from FBX so, in general, anything that FBX supports, PlayCanvas also supports. As such, to target PlayCanvas, you do not have to use any special Max plugins and there are no specific workflows you must follow. However, it is worth being aware of what will and what will not translate from Max through FBX to PlayCanvas.

### Materials

You should use the Standard material type in Max, or the Multi/Sub-Object material type providing the materials it references are Standard materials.

#### Supported Map Slots

PlayCanvas interprets a subset of the 3DS Max material map types on export. Note that maps can be in any format that 3DS Max supports, but if the maps are not in a web format (namely JPEG, GIF or PNG) then they will be converted to these formats on export.

##### Diffuse Color

Assigning a Bitmap map to this slot enables diffuse mapping on the PlayCanvas material. This essentially overrides whatever diffuse color has been set on the material (via the color picker). If the diffuse map has an alpha channel, it will be used as the per pixel alpha value in the PlayCanvas runtime.

Additionally, it is possible to assign an RGB Multiply map to the Diffuse Color slot. This has the effect of enabling lightmapping, where Map 1 is the diffuse map and Map 2 is the lightmap.

##### Specular Color

Assigning a Bitmap map to this slot enables specular mapping in the PlayCanvas material. This essentially overrides whatever specular color has been set on the material (via the color picker). This allows you to mask out areas of specularity on a surface, or tinge specular highlights different colors in different areas. If the specular map has an alpha channel, it will be used to set per-pixel shininess.

##### Self-Illumination

Assigning a Bitmap map to this slot enables emissive mapping in the PlayCanvas material. An emissive map can be full RGB (you are not limited to greyscale) and will essentially be added to the result of lighting a surface. So a black pixel in a emissive map will result add nothing to a pixel’s value.  Anything else will increase a pixel’s luminosity.

##### Opacity

Assigning a Bitmap map to this slot enables opacity mapping on the PlayCanvas material. A black pixel in the opacity map will be fully transparent, a white pixel will be fully opaque and any grey pixel will correspond to some equivalent intermediate alpha value.

If the material has an opacity map, it will override any alpha channel that may have been set in the diffuse map. It is less efficient to use the opacity map slot over the alpha channel of the diffuse map since two textures are generated in the PlayCanvas runtime instead of one and the default shader must do a little more work. However, if performance is not a concern and it is convenient to use an opacity map, the functionality is supported.

##### Bump

Assigning a Normal Bump map to this slot enables normal mapping. Note that, by default, the ‘Amount’ value for the Bump slot is set to 30. PlayCanvas effectively ignores this value and treats it as if it were set to 100, so it is recommended that you set this to 100 in Max also in order to make a render match the realtime rendering more closely.

There are different ways to author normal maps, the main two differing in the format of the green component. For example, by default, 3DS Max would expect a normal map for a brick wall to appear as follows:

[TODO]

Notice lighter areas at the bottom edge of raised areas. PlayCanvas expects the green component (or the Y component of each normal in the normal map) to be flipped. Loading the file into Photoshop, selecting the green channel and pressing Ctrl+I to invert the channel gives:

[TODO]

Now, lighting in PlayCanvas will be consistent.

If the assigned normal map has an alpha channel, it will be treated as a parallax map with the alpha channel interpreted as a height map. Lighter areas of the height map are treated as ‘higher’ than the darker areas.

##### Reflection

Assigning a Bitmap map to this slot enables sphere mapping in the PlayCanvas material. The bitmap would look something like this:

[TODO]

Sphere mapping is one of the cheapest, least ‘convincing’ forms of reflection mapping, but in many scenarios it is sufficient to provide a pleasing glossy sheen to surfaces.

#### Meshes

There are a few things to be aware of when creating meshes in the modelling application:

* Each mesh object should contain no more than 65,535 vertices.
* NURBS meshes will be converted to triangle meshes on conversion to the PlayCanvas native format.
* Meshes can be skinned to an arbitrary number of bones. PlayCanvas does not impose an upper limit.
