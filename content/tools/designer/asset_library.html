# Asset Library

When you are building your game with PlayCanvas, you will probably want to use 3D models and animations to make it look and play great! The Asset Library is a growing repository of free content that you can import into your game with a single click.

## Accessing the Asset Library

The Asset Library can be opened from PlayCanvas Designer. Just hit the big orange button in the top right of the interface:

<img alt="Asset Library Button" src="/media/images/platform/asset_library/asset_library_button.png" />

The Asset Library opens in a dialog that shows the thumbnails of all assets that can be imported into your project:

<img alt="Asset Library" src="/media/images/platform/asset_library/asset_library_open.png" />

Choose an asset and hit the 'Add' button. Note that assets can only be imported into a project once, after which the 'Add' button becomes greyed out.

The import process will take a few seconds (depending on how large the asset is). Once the process is complete, a new Model Entity will be created as a child of your scene's root Entity with the asset assigned. The new Entity will inherit the name of the asset.

Here's a video showing the process in action:

## Finding More Assets

Assets in the Asset Library are grouped by provider. To find more assets to use in your games, follow the link back to each provider's web site.
