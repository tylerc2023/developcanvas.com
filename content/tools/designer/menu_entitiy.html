## New Entity

Create a new Entity. The new Entity is inserted into the Pack as a child of the currently selected Entity. 


## New [Template] Entity

Create a new Entity from a built in template. This creates a new Entity as the New Entity command but it also adds Components and sets up their properties as a shortcut for commonly used types of Entities. For example, you can create a new Camera Entity, which adds a Camera Component, or a Model Entity which adds a Model Component.

## Delete

Deletes the currently selected Entities.
