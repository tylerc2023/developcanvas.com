# PlayCanvas Designer

The PlayCanvas Designer is a visual editing tool which you use to create and edit the [Packs](/glossary.html#pack) and [Entities](/glossary.html#entity) that make up your game. 

* Runs in your browser, so it's available wherever you are.
* Uses the PlayCanvas Engine to render your scene. What you see is what you get.
* One button press and you are playing your game in a new tab.
* Live editing means that you can iterate on your game, even while it's running.

## Interface

![Designer Interface](/media/images/platform/designer_interface.png "Designer Interface")

This is the main interface to the PlayCanvas Designer. You can see labeled the main areas

* **Menubar** Drop-down menus allow you to initiate almost all commands available in the Designer
* **Toolbar** Commonly used commands are available on the toolbar for quick access.
* **Pack Explorer** A hierarchical view of the Entities that make up the open Pack. Use this to select, delete and re-parent Entities.
* **Attribute Editor** Detailed properties of each [Component](/glossary.html#component) attached to the selected Entity.
* **Design View** A 3D view onto your scene, use this view to select, position and orientate Entities.

### Menubar and Toolbar

Just like a standard desktop application, the menubar contains a complete list of all the commands that you can perform on your pack. This is where you add new Entities and Components as 
well as perform standard operations like Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy and Paste. (N.B. Cut, Copy and Paste are currently not implemented)

### Pack Explorer

![Pack Explorer](/media/images/platform/pack_explorer.png "Explore packs to discover their secrets")

The Pack Explorer shows you a tree view of your entire Pack which is made up from a hierarchy of Entities. A Pack will always contain the Pack Entity at the top of the tree, 
and also a Designer Entity which contains special Entities used by the PlayCanvas Designer, you won't be able to access these at runtime in your code. All the other Entities you see here have been added by the developer.

All Entities in your Pack will be visible in the Pack Explorer, and clicking on the Entity in the Pack Explorer will select it. 

The order in which Entities are listed in the tree view is important, as the transform matrix of a parent Entity is applied to all it's children. So, if you move or rotate the 'Geometry' Entity in the image above, 
all the platforms in the level will be moved. This is very useful for simplifying the manipulation of many Entities, but be careful, in a deep tree, 
it's not alway obvious where an Entity gets it's position from if a ancestor has been moved. 

Re-parenting Entities to move them around in the hierarchy is a feature that is coming soon.

### Attribute Editor

The Attribute Editors shows attribute values for all the Components in the selected Entity. Modifying these values is how you specify how your Entity behaves. For example, you 
can set which model asset to render for a Model Component, or what color a light is.
