# PlayCanvas Designer

The PlayCanvas Designer is a visual editing tool which you use to create and edit the [Packs](/glossary.html#pack) and [Entities](/glossary.html#entity) that make up your game. 

* Runs in your browser, so it's available wherever you are.
* Uses the PlayCanvas Engine to render your scene. What you see is what you get.
* One button press and you are playing your game in a new tab.
* Live editing means that you can iterate on your game, even while it's running.

## Interface

![Designer Interface](/media/images/platform/designer_interface.png "Designer Interface")

This is the main interface to the PlayCanvas Designer. You can see labeled the main areas

* **Menubar** Drop-down menus allow you to initiate almost all commands available in the Designer
* **Toolbar** Commonly used commands are available on the toolbar for quick access.
* **Pack Explorer** A hierarchical view of the Entities that make up the open Pack. Use this to select, delete and re-parent Entities.
* **Attribute Editor** Detailed properties of each [Component](/glossary.html#component) attached to the selected Entity.
* **Design View** A 3D view onto your scene, use this view to select, position and orientate Entities.

### Menubar and Toolbar

![Menubar](/media/images/platform/menu_bar.png "Barring any mistakes the menubar contains all the commands you need")

Just like a standard desktop application, the menubar contains a complete list of all the commands that you can perform on your pack. This is where you add new Entities and Components as 
well as perform standard operations like Save, Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy and Paste. (N.B. Cut, Copy and Paste are features that are coming soon)

The Toolbar features common commands for easy access, the most useful one of all is the Play Button. The Play Button launches a game instance in a separate browser tab and loads 
your Pack. You can then start play testing immediately. See the section on the Attribute Editor for how to edit values on a live running instance of your game. 

### Pack Explorer

![Pack Explorer](/media/images/platform/pack_explorer.png "Explore packs to discover their secrets")

The Pack Explorer shows you a tree view of your entire Pack which is made up from a hierarchy of Entities. A Pack will always contain the Pack Entity at the top of the tree, 
and the Designer Entity, which contains special Entities used by the PlayCanvas Designer. You won't be able to access these at runtime in your code. 
All the other Entities you see here have been added by the developer.

The Pack Explorer is great for quickly finding Entities as all the Entities in you Pack will be visible all the time, clicking on the Entity in the Pack Explorer will select it.

The order in which Entities are listed in the tree view is important. As the Pack is a hierarchy, Entities can be *children* of another Entity -- their *parent* -- 
and the transform matrix of a parent Entity is applied to all it's children. So if you move or rotate the 'Geometry' Entity in the image above, 
all the Platform Entities will be moved. This is very useful for simplifying the manipulation of many Entities, but be careful, in a deep tree, 
it's not alway obvious where an Entity gets it's position from if a ancestor has been moved. 

Re-parenting Entities to move them around in the hierarchy is a feature that is coming soon.

### Attribute Editor

![Attribute Editor](/media/images/platform/attribute_editor.png "Edit attributes until you can edit no more")

The Attribute Editors shows attribute values for all the Components in the selected Entity. Modifying these values is how you specify how your Entity behaves. For example, you 
can set which model asset to render for a Model Component, or what color a light is.

Some attributes are simple text or numbers in which case a standard text field or slider control will be used. Other values may require a more specialised input method. For example, 
choosing an Asset uses a special dialog which displays Assets that you have uploaded to the Depot. Some values can be manipulated via the Design View, for example, the Translate, 
Rotate and Scale values can be editted by moving and Entity dragging the relevant [Gizmo](/glossary.html#gizmo) around in the Design View.

When running a game and the Designer simultaneously changes to attributes will be transmitted to Entities in the running application. An excellent way of iterating on values is to launch 
your game using the Play button place the Designer and the game tabs side by side and tweak values in the Designer as you watch and play the game. Then once your happy with the changes, 
save the Pack in the Designer.

### Design View

![Design View](/media/images/platform/design_view.png "Get a view on your design")

The Design View shows you the scene rendered by your Pack. You can freely move around the scene by manipulating the Designer's current camera. Initially the Designer is in single view
mode, you will a single *Perspective* scene, filling the viewport. By clicking the 'Q' button on the toolbar you can toggle quad view mode. This will render 4 camera angles simultaneously, 
from the *Front*, *Side*, *Top* and also the *Perspective* view.

Quad view is great for aligning objects in 3D space as you can see the object from all angles at once.

The 3-Colored Axis you can see in the screenshot above is called a [Gizmo](/glossary.html#gizmo). This is used to manipulate the transform matrix of the selected Entity. There are three 
types of Gizmo: Translate with arrows on the ends of the axes; Scale with cubes on the ends of the axes and Rotate which is made up of three colored rings.
