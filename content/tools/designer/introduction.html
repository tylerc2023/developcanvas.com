# What is PlayCanvas?

PlayCanvas is a visual development platform for 3D web content. Both the tools and the web apps you build are powered by HTML5. The entire software platform is web hosted so there's nothing to install and you can access your work from any device that runs one of the supported web browsers.

# The PlayCanvas Workflow

Building 3D web apps with PlayCanvas Platform is easy (and fun!). To get the best out of PlayCanvas, you will need to write some code (specifically some Javascript, the language of the web). However, the PlayCanvas toolset is designed to allow you to visually edit your project and publish it with incredible simplicity.

Let's take a look at the high level workflow:

Your projects are created and managed by PlayCanvas Platform in the cloud. As you build your web app, you will want to start incorporating 3D assets (a car, a spaceship, an animated character, etc). PlayCanvas Platform allows you to import assets that have been exported from just about any 3D content creation tool, including 3D Studio Max, Maya, SketchUp and Blender. Once these assets are imported into your asset library, you can quickly deploy them into your app.

The other major asset type in a PlayCanvas project is code. PlayCanvas Platform offers the developer a wide variety of pre-baked functional components that can be bolted together to construct game entities. But it is possible to customize and extend the default behaviour of these components through the writing of scripts. For example, you might write a script that defines the handling of a vehicle or the AI of a non-player character. The code can be developed and served from a local web server or pulled from a linked repository hosted by BitBucket or GitHub.

Lastly, you will want to publish your web app. PlayCanvas Platform can take a snapshot of your project at any time and export it to a downloadable ZIP file. You are then free to transfer the contents of the ZIP to the web server of your choice. All models, textures, scripts etc will be present and correct.
