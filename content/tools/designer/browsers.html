# Browser Compatibility

PlayCanvas was always designed to be plugin free, running natively in the browser. The client-side codebase is 100% Javascript and built entirely on HTML5 and related APIs (such as WebGL). Why was this important?

* Mobile/tablet devices do not permit plugin installation and continue to improve support for HTML5.
* PlayCanvas web apps load seamlessly without a plugin install or plugin load step.
* PlayCanvas web apps run in a standard DOM element (a canvas) and you can composite it on the page or transform it via CSS.
* You are not beholden to a third party plugin technology which may change over time. The only dependency is on the browser itself.

So obviously this is all very good news, but you want your web app to run everywhere. Any device, any browser. At the time of writing, HTML5 continues to be adopted on more and more devices in more and more browsers. The browser requirements are currently as follows:

## Graphics Driver Issues

Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox disable WebGL functionality if the installed graphics card driver is found to be old or buggy. Therefore, it is best to ensure that your graphics driver is up to date. For more information on the exact rules for the blacklisting of graphics drivers, head to [this page](http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/BlacklistsAndWhitelists).

## IE and Google Chrome Frame

Microsoft's Internet Explorer is the only mainstream browser that has no native support for WebGL. However, Google has created a very lightweight IE plugin that can selectively load a page and render it with the Chrome rendering engine, thereby enabling WebGL. For more information on how GCF can be enabled on a page, head [here](http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/chrome-frame-getting-started). In actual fact, web apps generated by PlayCanvas Platform are already GCF-enabled, so the work is already done! If you run your app in IE and do not already have GCF installed, you will be offered the single click option to add it. Until IE supports WebGL, GCF is definitely the best and most elegant alternative.
