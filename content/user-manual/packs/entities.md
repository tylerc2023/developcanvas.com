Every object in your game is an Entity, but on it's own an Entity is nothing more than a position and orientation in space. In order to give an Entity a behaviour you must add Components. The PlayCanvas Engine contains built-in Components which add lots of userful behaviour such as rendering a 3D model or playing audio. Using the Script Component custom behaviour can be written in Javascript.

Entities are edited in the PlayCanvas Designer. The Entity hierarchy is displayed in the Pack Explorer.
