## Creating New Assets

To upload an asset to PlayCanvas, follow these steps:

###Â In the Dashboard

* Navigate to the home page of the project to which the asset will be added.
* Select the 'Assets' tab and the project's asset list will be displayed.
* Drag and drop and asset file from your computer onto the top of the asset form. The drop area will expand to accept your file.
* Alternatively, select the 'New Asset' link to navigate to the upload form.
* The asset will now start to upload.

### In the Designer

* Drag and drop your asset file into the Designer window.
* A progress bar will appear along the bottom.
* When the progress bar has disappeared your asset is ready to use.

Now, when you attempt to choose an asset via the asset picker attribute control (for the Model component or the Animation component for example), your asset will be available for assignment.

Note, if you have the Designer open while uploading assets to the Dashboard, the asset panel won't automatiically update. You can click the refresh button on the right of the Asset Panel to reload the list of Assets.

## Updating Existing Assets

If you want to update an Asset that you have already created follow the same steps as above. If you upload an Asset of the same type and same name as an existing Asset, PlayCanvas will update the existing asset with new upload.
