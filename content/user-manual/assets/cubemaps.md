Cube maps are a special type of texture asset. They are formed from 6 texture assets where each texture represents the face of a cube. They typically have two uses:

# A cube map can define your scene's sky box. A sky box contains imagery of the distant visuals of your scene such as hills, mountains, the sky and so on.
# A cube map can add reflections to any material. Imagine a shiny, chrome ball bearing in your scene. The ball reflects the surrounding scene. For open environments, you would normally set the scene's sky box cube map as the cube map on a reflective object's materials.
