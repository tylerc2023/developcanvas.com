Textures assets are image files which are used as part of a [material][material] to give a 3D model a realistic appearance.

We accept a wide variety of image files as the source for a texture asset. After uploading textures will be converted to a web-friendly format. Currently the conversion process is this:

* PNG files are converted to PNG files. This preserves transparency.
* All other files are converted to JPEG files. This does not preserve transparency.
