Audio assets are sound files which can be played back using the Audiosource component.

Any audio format that is supported by the web-browser is supported by PlayCanvas. No processing is done to the audio file on import.

Note: not all formats are supported in all browsers. As of writing the most widely supported formats are MP3 or Ogg, though neither format works across all platforms.
