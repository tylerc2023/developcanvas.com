The PlayCanvas Designer is a visual editing tool which you use to create and edit the [Packs][pack] and [Entities][entity] that make up your game.

* Runs in your browser, so it's available wherever you are.
* Uses the PlayCanvas Engine to render your scene. What you see is what you get.
* One button press and you are playing your game in a new tab.
* Live editing means that you can iterate on your game, even while it's running.
