The panel can be accessed by selecting 'Show Designer Settings' from Designer's View menu:

## Grid Settings

Grid settings affect the rendering of the grid that appears inside the 3D View. You can control how many divisions you want the Grid to have and how large you want each division to be. These units are in meters.

## Snap Settings

Here you can set the snap increment which will be used when you have Snap enabled. Snap is disabled by default and you can toggle it on / off from the toolbar or by holding Shift:

<img alt="Snap Tool" src="/images/platform/designer_settings/snap_tool.png" />

When you have Snap enabled then Entities will snap to the closest increment from their starting position / rotation / scale when you move / rotate or scale them using the [Gizmos][gizmo].

## Camera Settings

Here you can control various properties of the camera used for the 3D view, like the clear color that will be used or the near and far clip planes of the camera.
