The brightness-contrast effect allows you to modify the brightness and contrast of the rendered image.

Here is an image without the effect:

<img alt="Image without effect" src="/images/platform/posteffects/without_effects.png"></img>

and the same image with the effect applied and changes to brightness and contrast:

<img alt="Image with effect" src="/images/platform/posteffects/with_brightness_contrast.png"></img>

The built-in brightness-contrast effect has the following attributes:
* **brightness**: The brighness of the image. Ranges from -1 to 1 (-1 is solid black, 0 no change, 1 solid white).
* **contrast**: The contrast of the image. Ranges from -1 to 1 (-1 is solid gray, 0 no change, 1 maximum contrast).
