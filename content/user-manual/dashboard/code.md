The code dashboard allows you view and edit code files that are used in your project. 

There are two main methods for adding code to your project. Using PlayCanvas for your code repository or using a code repository from a third-party service like Github or Bitbucket.

## PlayCanvas 

When using PlayCanvas for your code, you can use the Code Dashboard to rename, delete and edit your code files.

## Github or Bitbucket

When using a third-party code repository, you can use the Code Dashboard to set up the username and repository on the service and sync to the latest code.

Note, you must be authenticated with the other service before you can sync up your code.
