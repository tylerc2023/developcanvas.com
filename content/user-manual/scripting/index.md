Scripting is how you make your game interactive. Scripts are written in **Javascript**. This is the programming language used by web pages everywhere. 

You can think of your application as divided into two separate code bases. The [Engine][engine_overview], which is provided by PlayCanvas, and implements general purpose functionality such as graphics rendering, input handling, audio, and the interface to the PlayCanvas tools; and Scripts which will often be specific to your application or re-usable chunks that provide useful behaviours.

Generally you won't have to worry about the engine code, it's a single javascript file included into your application via a `<script>` tag. If you're rewriting parts of the engine you probably don't need this introduction to scripting.

Scripts are individual javascript files, which are attached to Script [Components](/glossary.html#component) on [Entities](/glossary.html#entity) via the PlayCanvas Designer. Generally, a script file should define a single javascript object which is instantiated once for each Entity that it is attached to. 

## Terminology

First off, lets define a few pieces of terminology.

* ***Script*** A script is single javascript file which includes the correct javascript to define a script object
* ***Script Component*** The script Component is defined in the PlayCanvas engine and gives a game Entity the functionality that loads a script and creates a script object.
* ***Script Object*** A script object is a standard javascript object which is registered with the PlayCanvas engine and can be instantiated when a new script Component is created. There will generally only be a single script object of each type per application.
* ***Script Instance*** A script instance is script object which has been instantiated at runtime, using the `new` keyword in javascript. A script instance is created for every Entity that has the script attached.
