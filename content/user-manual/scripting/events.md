Events are a useful way of responding to things that happen without checking every frame.

The PlayCanvas Engine contains a simple way to add event handling to any object:

~~~javascript~~~
pc.script.create("player", function (context) {
    var Player = function (entity) {
        this.entity = entity;

        // Attach event functions
        pc.events.attach(this);
    };

    Player.prototype = {
        //...
    };

    return Player;
});
~~~

In the constructor of Player, we're calling `pc.events.attach()` which adds event functions to the Player instance.

## Using events

Listen for events firing by using `on()` and `off()`

`player.on("move", function (x, y) { console.log("Player moved"); }, this)`

Fire events using `fire()`

`player.fire("move", x, y);`
