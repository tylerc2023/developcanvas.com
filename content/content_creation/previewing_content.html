# PlayCanvas Visualizer

The PlayCanvas Visualizer is useful for previewing individual models and animations. Naturally, it runs in the browser and appears as follows:

<img alt="Visualizer" width="640" height="480" src="/media/images/artist_guide/visualizer.jpg"></img>

It is possible to invoke Visualizer directly from the modelling application, allowing fast iteration of PlayCanvas content generation. This guide will step you through the running and operation of Visualizer.

### Running the PlayCanvas Visualizer

Once you have installed the PlayCanvas Asset Tools and followed the instructions for copying the Max or Maya visualizer scripts to your Max/Maya installation, you will notice that you have a new 'PlayCanvas' menu when you restart your modelling application. For 3DS Max, the menu looks as follows:

<img alt="Max Visualizer Menu" width="301" height="177" src="/media/images/artist_guide/visualizer_menu_max.jpg"></img>

In Maya, it is essentially the same:

<img alt="Maya Visualizer Menu" width="301" height="177" src="/media/images/artist_guide/visualizer_menu_maya.jpg"></img>

### Starting the Visualizer HTTP Server

Before you can visualize a scene in Max/Maya, you must select 'Start Visualizer Server' from the PlayCanvas menu,. This will invoke a DOS box running a local HTTP server which serves the Visualizer web application and scenes exported from Max/Maya to the web browser. The server will continue to run until the DOS box is forcibly closed. But you must ensure it is running as long as you want 3DS Max or Maya to be sending scenes to Visualizer.

### Visualizing your First Scene

Now you should be ready to view your first scene in the PlayCanvas Visualizer! Build some polygonals objects (cubes/spheres/etc) in the 3D viewport, and then select 'Visualize' from the PlayCanvas menu. Alternatively, you can select specific objects in your 3D scene and select 'Visualize Selected' to only view those objects in the browser.

Use of Visualizer is demonstrated in the video below:

<video width="640" height="480" controls="controls">
  <source src="/media/video/artist_guide/visualizer.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.

### Visualizer Controls

To navigate the camera in the PlayCanvas Visualizer, use the following controls:

* Mouse Wheel: Dolly the camera backwards and forwards.
* ALT+Left Mouse Button: Orbit the camera.
* ALT+Middle Mouse Button: Pan the camera.
