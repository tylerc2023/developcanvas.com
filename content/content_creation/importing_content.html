# Importing Assets

## Creating New Assets

To upload an asset to PlayCanvas, follow these steps:

* Navigate to the home page of the project to which the asset will be added. 
* Select the 'Assets' tab and the project's asset list will be displayed.
* Select the 'New Asset' link to navigate to the upload form.
* Select 'Choose File...' and browse to the asset file. Alternatively, you can drag and drop an asset from your local filesystem onto the upload control.
* Once the asset is specified in the 'Name:' field, select 'Upload and Create' to add the asset to your asset library.

Now, when you attempt to choose an asset via the asset picker attribute control (for the Model component or the Animation component for example), your asset will be available for assignment.

## Updating Existing Assets

If you want to update an asset that you have already created, do the following:

* Select the link on the relevant asset's name in the Assets tab of the Project dashboard. This will take you to the 'Update Asset' page.
* Select 'Choose File...' and browse to the asset file. Alternatively, you can drag and drop an asset from your local filesystem onto the upload control.
* Once the asset is specified in the 'Name:' field, select 'Upload and Create' to update the asset in your asset library.

Note that you will have to reload Designer in order to see updated assets (ensuring that the browser cache is cleared or disabled).
