# PlayCanvas Asset Tools

The PlayCanvas Asset Tools are a set of programs that can:

* Convert FBX files into PlayCanvas-friendly format.
* Send scenes directly from 3DS Max to the PlayCanvas runtime in the browser for rapid iteration.

## System Requirements

* Microsoft Windows XP SP2, Windows Vista or Windows 7.
* Autodesk 3DS Max 2010 or greater.
* Autodesk Maya 2010 or greater.
* FBX plugin 2010.2.1 or greater.
* Google Chrome 12.0.xxx.xx or greater.
* Ensure your PC supports WebGL by visiting [this page](http://get.webgl.org/). In the majority of cases, WebGL will fail to run because you do not have recent graphics adapter drivers installed. Verify this by visiting [amd.com](http://support.amd.com/us/Pages/AMDSupportHub.aspx) or [nvidia.com](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) (or the web site of your graphics card manufacturer).

## Known Issues

* The PlayCanvas Asset Tools uninstaller does not delete temporary files creating by the tools. These can be found in `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\PlayCanvas` on Windows Vista and Windows 7.  On Windows XP, these are found at `C:\Documents and Settings\<USERNAME>\Local Settings\Application Data\PlayCanvas`. All files found here can be safely deleted at any time.
* Installing the asset tools will not uninstall any previous versions. Please uninstall any existing version before updating to a more recent installer.

## Installing the PlayCanvas Asset Tools

* Download playcanvas-asset-tools-x.x.x.msi.

### Install the PlayCanvas 3DS Max Script

This step is only necessary if you have 3DS Max installed and you want to integrate the PlayCanvas Visualizer into Max's menu.

Locate the file playcanvas.ms in `<PLAYCANVAS_INSTALL_DIR>\tools\3dsmax` and copy this to the `stdplugins\stdscripts` folder in your 3DS Max install.

### Install the PlayCanvas Maya Script

This step is only necessary if you have Maya installed and you want to integrate the PlayCanvas Visualizer into Maya's menu.

Locate the files playcanvas.py and userSetup.py in `<PLAYCANVAS_INSTALL_DIR>\tools\maya` and copy them to the `<YOUR_USER_PROFILE>\Documents\Maya\scripts` folder. If you already have a userSetup.py file (that executes Python statements every time you start Maya), you simply need to merge the contents of the PlayCanvas file into your existing file.
