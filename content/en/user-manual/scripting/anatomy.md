*A skeleton script*

Here is the skeleton of a script, it shows the minimum amount of code necessary to make a functioning script.

<div class="alert alert-info">
Actually, you could leave the `initialize` and `update` methods out of a script. But most scripts will need an update method in order to actually do anything, and initialize is useful for setting up values before your game starts.
</div>

We'll break down each part of this script section by section.

## Declaration and Application

~~~js~~~
pc.script.create("script_name", function(app) {
    //...
});
~~~

Enclosing the whole script is a call to `pc.script.create`. The first argument is the script name, this is used to identify this script later if you wish to communicate between script instances. The second argument is a function which is used to define the class that provides the script's behaviour.

The definition function takes a single argument `app` which is the [`Application`][1] instance.

The `app` variable is available for use throughout your script object because `ScriptObject` is a Closure. It contains various useful properties.

* `systems` Container for all Component systems, e.g. `app.systems.model` is the Model Component System
* `root` The root node of the Entity hierarchy.
* `keyboard` An instance of `pc.Keyboard`
* `mouse` An instance of `pc.Mouse`
* `scene` An instance of `pc.Scene`
* `assets` An instance of `pc.AssetRegistry` for loading and accessing assets

See the [API Reference][2] for more details on the pc.Application object.

## Defining the Script object

~~~js~~~
pc.script.create("script_name", function (app) {
    var ScriptObject = function (entity) {
        this.entity = entity;
    }

    ScriptObject.prototype = {
        initialize: function () {

        },

        update: function (dt) {

        }
    };

    return ScriptObject;
})
~~~

The purpose of the function in the second argument is to define a Script object and return that definition so that the engine can instantiate a new instance for each Entity.

Here you can see the basic set up. A variable `ScriptObject` is declared as a constructor function which takes the Entity it is attached to as it's only argument. It is usually useful to store this Entity in the instance for use later on, hence the line `this.entity = entity;` You will often create member variables for your object here too.

Next we define the initialize and update functions. `initialize()` is called once for each Script Instance. It is called after all Entities are loaded (so that the Entity hierarchy in `app.root` is valid) but before any `update()` methods are called.
`update()` is the update loop for our script. The Script Component system will call the update function every frame with the time in seconds that passed since the last update in the variable `dt`. Note, that both these function are optional and should be left out if they are not being used.

Finally, we return the `ScriptObject` variable.

## Built-in script methods

Here is a list of all methods of a Script that are called by the engine if they exist, in the order that they are called.

`initialize()`

This is the first method called on a script after all Entities are loaded. Use it for initialization.

`onEnable()`

Called whenever the Script Component that this script is attached to or its Entity get enabled. Also called right after the `initialize` method. Use this for things that should happen every time the Script Component or Entity get enabled.

`postInitialize()`

Called after `onEnable`. Use this to order initialization of different scripts for example you might want some scripts to initialize after a different script has been initialized.

`update(dt)`

Called every frame with the time in seconds that passed since the last update in the variable `dt`. Use this for things that should run continuously like moving objects, applying forces, checking for input etc. If you don't need an update method then delete it for better performance.

`postUpdate(dt)`

Called every frame after the `update` method with the same `dt` as the `update` method. Use this to perform actions needed after the `update` step, for example Camera scripts that follow Entities should be moved in `postUpdate` because they might be tracking Entities that have moved in `update`.

`onDisable()`

Called when the Script Component that this script is attached to or its Entity get disabled. Also called right before the `destroy` method. Use this for things that should happen every time the Script Component or Entity get disabled.

`destroy()`

Called when the Script Component that this script is attached to or its Entity get destroyed. Use this to clean up.

`onAttributeChanged(name, oldValue, newValue)`

Called when the value of a [Script Attribute][3] is changed from the Editor. The name of the attribute and its old and new values are passed in the method. Use this to update your script if an attribute changes.

## A complete example

Here is a complete script, try saving it to a file and attaching it to an Entity in a pack.

~~~js~~~
///
// This script moves the entity backwards and forwards on the x-axis.
// You can pause the oscillation by pressing the space bar.
///
pc.script.create('oscillator', function (app) {

    // define the constructor
    var Oscillator = function (entity) {
        this.entity = entity;

        this.paused = false; // paused state
        this.amplitude = 10; // The amount to oscillate
        this.time = 0; // The time value for the oscillation
    };

    // define the update function
    Oscillator.prototype = {
        update: function (dt) {

            // Use the keyboard handler from the Application
            // to pause/unpause
            if (app.keyboard.wasPressed(pc.KEY_SPACE)) {
                this.paused = !this.paused; // toggle paused state
            }

            if (!this.paused) {
                // increment the time value by the frametime
                this.time += dt;

                // Calculate the new value
                var x = this.amplitude * Math.sin(this.time);

                // Update the x position of the Entity
                this.entity.setLocalPosition(x, 0, 0);
            }
        }
    };

    // return the class definition
    return Oscillator;
});
