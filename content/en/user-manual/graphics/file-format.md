Generally speaking, you do not need to know the structure of the file format used to serialize your models. However, this section describes the format for those who are interested in writing their own file converters.

To get models into PlayCanvas, you have to upload an FBX (or OBJ, DAE, DXJ, 3DS) file. On the server, this file is converted to a JSON format. This format is textual. Let's take a look at a very simple example of a plane consisting of two triangles:

```javascript
{
  "model": {
    "version": 2,
    "nodes": [
      {
        "name": "RootNode",
        "position": [ 0, 0, 0 ],
        "rotation": [ 0, 0, 0 ],
        "scale": [ 1, 1, 1 ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Plane",
        "position": [ 0, 0, 0 ],
        "rotation": [ 0, 0, 0 ],
        "scale": [ 1, 1, 1 ]
      }
    ],
    "parents": [ -1, 0 ],
    "skins": [],
    "vertices": [
      {
        "position": {
          "type": "float32",
          "components": 3,
          "data": [ 1, 1, 0, -1, 1, 0, -1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0 ]
        },
        "normal": {
          "type": "float32",
          "components": 3,
          "data": [ 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1 ]
        }
      }
    ],
    "meshes": [
      {
        "aabb": {
          "min": [ -1, -1, 0 ],
          "max": [ 1, 1, 0 ]
        },
        "vertices": 0,
        "indices": [ 0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 3 ],
        "type": "triangles",
        "base": 0,
        "count": 6
      }
    ],
    "meshInstances": [
      {
        "node": 1,
        "mesh": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Here is a reference for the different properties that appear in the JSON object above:

<table>
  <tr><th>Property</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>model</td><td>Denotes that this JSON object is a PlayCanvas model.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>version</td><td>The version of the JSON object. Current head version is 2.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>nodes</td><td>An array of nodes that constitute the scene hierarchy. The array is flat but the 'parents' array specifies the parent-child relationships between scene nodes.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>name</td><td>The node's name (usually assigned by an artist).</td></tr>
  <tr><td>position</td><td>3-component position (XYZ) relative to the node's parent.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>rotation</td><td>3-component Euler angle rotation (XYZ) relative to the node's parent. Units are degrees.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>scale</td><td>3-component scale (XYZ) relative to the node's parent.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>parents</td><td>Array of parent node indices. The root node has a parent of -1. In the example above, the node 'Plane' has 'RootNode' for a parent.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>skins</td><td>Skinning data is left undocumented for now.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>vertices</td>
    <td>
      An array of objects containing vertex information. Each object has a number of vertex properties. These can be:
      <ul>
        <li>position: vertex positions</li>
        <li>normal: vertex normals</li>
        <li>texCoord0: first texture coordinate set</li>
        <li>texCoord1: second texture coordinate set</li>
        <li>skinWeights: vertex skin weights</li>
        <li>skinIndices: vertex skin indices</li>
        <li>color: vertex colors</li>
      </ul>
      Each property has a type (float32, uint8, uint16, uint64) and a number of components (1-4).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>meshes</td><td>An array of mesh objects. Mesh are used to interpret how vertex information is rendered.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>aabb</td><td>The axis-aligned local space bounding box of a mesh.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>min</td><td>The minimum coordinate of the mesh's axis-aligned bounding box.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>max</td><td>The maximum coordinate of the mesh's axis-aligned bounding box.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>vertices</td><td>The index of the vertex information object referenced by this mesh.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>indices</td><td>An array of indices that defines the points of the primitive represented by the mesh.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>type</td>
    <td>The type of the primitive of this mesh. Can be:
      <ul>
        <li>points</li>
        <li>lines</li>
        <li>lineloop</li>
        <li>linestrip</li>
        <li>triangles</li>
        <li>trianglestrip</li>
        <li>trianglefan</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>base</td><td>The first index used by this mesh.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>count</td><td>The number of indices used by this mesh.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>meshInstances</td><td>An array of objects representing instances of meshes. A single mesh can be shared between multiple mesh instances. This is an optimization that saves memory at runtime.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>node</td><td>The index of the node referenced by this mesh instance.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>mesh</td><td>The index of the mesh referenced by this mesh instance.</td></tr>
