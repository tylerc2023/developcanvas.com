## Seated VR

Seated VR includes devices such as Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear VR and Oculus Rift. These experiences are based around the user remaining roughly stationary. In some cases there is no positional data available (e.g. Google Cardboard) and only the orientation of the headset is used.

## Room Scale VR

Room Scale VR includes devices such as the Oculus Quest, HTC Vive and many others. Room scale experiences are designed to allow a small or large amount of movement away from the origin position of the scene.

## Augmented Reality

Augmented Reality allows blending real world with virtual imagery, either by composing rendered buffer over camera feed or with special projection of rendered buffer on see through glasses. Usually it is provided with spatial tracking relative to the real world environment.
