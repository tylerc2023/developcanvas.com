## Menu

![Menu][1]

The menu is available by clicking on the PLAYCANVAS icon and contains a complete list of all the commands that you can perform on your scene. If you can't find a button or remember a hotkey, the command will always be available in the menu.

##Â Toolbar

The Toolbar features common commands for easy access, the most useful one of all is the Launch Button. The Launch Button starts a game instance in a separate browser tab and loads your Scene. You can then start play testing immediately. See the section on the Attribute Editor for how to edit values on a live running instance of your game.
