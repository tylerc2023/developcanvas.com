The code dashboard allows you view and edit code files that are used in your project.

There are two main methods for adding code to your project. Using PlayCanvas for your code repository or using a code repository from a third-party service like Github or Bitbucket.

## PlayCanvas

When using PlayCanvas for your code, you can use the Code Dashboard to rename, delete and edit your code files.

## Git or Mercurial

When using a Git or Mercurial code repository, you can use the Code Dashboard to set up the clone URL of the repository and sync to the latest code.

Note, you must have permissions to access that repository before you can sync up your code. More on this [here][workflow].
