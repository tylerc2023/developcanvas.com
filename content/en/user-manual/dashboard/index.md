![Dashboard][1]

The Project Dashboard is the control centre for your project. From the dashboard you can view your project's development log, access and create new Packs, or upload and manage your assets. The project dashboard displays your code directory, either your PlayCanvas directory or your synced repository from a service like [Github][2] or [Bitbucket][3]. Finally, you can also publish your game live to the web, or export it to a zip file and download it.
