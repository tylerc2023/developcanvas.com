[Kongregate][1] is one of the biggest web game portals in the world. Originally a site for Flash games, they've been accepting HTML5 games for a while. Kongregate shares up to 50% of their advertising revenue with the game developer so they are a good place to start making money from your games.

In November 2018 Kongregate launched [Kartridge][7], a community-driven PC gaming platform focused on indie games.
