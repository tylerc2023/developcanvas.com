The 'script' component enables an entity to run user-supplied scripts. In this way, the user can write script (using the JavaScript language) that runs when the entity is instantiated and updated on a per-frame basis.

![Component Interface][1]

To assign a script, type its name into the URL box. For example, if you want to create a script called car.js, type car.js into the box and hit ENTER. This will create a script block below. If you click the hyperlinked script name, it will open in the PlayCanvas Code Editor. If you type a name of an existing script, autocomplete should activate and again, just press ENTER to add the script to the component.
