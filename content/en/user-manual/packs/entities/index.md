Every object in your game is an Entity, but on its own, an Entity is nothing more than a position and orientation in space. In order to give an Entity a behavior you must add Components. The PlayCanvas Engine contains built-in Components which add lots of useful behavior such as rendering a 3D model or playing audio. Using the Script Component custom behavior can be written in Javascript.

Entities are edited in the PlayCanvas Editor. The Entity hierarchy is displayed in the Hierarchy panel.
