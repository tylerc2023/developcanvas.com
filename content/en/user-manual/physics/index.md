Most video games you have ever played will have some form of physics. The player expects objects to fall under the influence of gravity. For objects to collide instead of pass through each other. For a sound to play if two objects collide. And so on.

A physics engine attempts to reproduce our understanding of the natural world in an artificial game world. It attempts to realistically animate objects in an expected and predictable way.

PlayCanvas provides a very powerful physics engine that can be used to achieve a great many effects. This section introduces the concepts of rigid bodies, collision, forces, impulses, raycasting and more.
