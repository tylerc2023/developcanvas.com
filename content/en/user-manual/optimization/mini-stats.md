The information displayed is as follows:

* **GPU** shows the number of milliseconds spent by the GPU rendering the frame
* **CPU** shows approximate number of milliseconds spent by the CPU
* **Frame** the total time in milliseconds for the browser to process each frame

The CPU and GPU graphs display a breakdown of the update and render portion of the frame using red and green respectively.
