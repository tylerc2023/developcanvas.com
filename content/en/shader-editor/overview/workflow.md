The workflow currently supported by Shader Editor is rudimentary and will be improved in future releases. In particular, we plan to add native integration of the Shader Editor with the PlayCanvas Editor.

Nonetheless, the general workflow when creating materials is as follows:

- Create a set of related materials in a Shader Editor project
- Export the materials to a *Shader Pack*
- Use the Shader Pack in your runtime application
