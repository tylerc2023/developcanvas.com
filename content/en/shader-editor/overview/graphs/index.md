Graphs are a central concept in Shader Editor. They are made up of nodes that do things, and edges that connect them together. Shader Editor uses the graphs to generate shader programs for rendering.

There are two distinct types of graphs in Shader Editor, namely [Material Graphs][2] and [Sub Graphs][3].

To find out how to manage graphs see the [Graph Editor][1] documentation.
