## How do I use physics?

To give physical properties to an Entity you need to add a [Collision component](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/packs/components/collision/) to it and a [RigidBody component](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/packs/components/rigidbody/). The Collision component gives a physical shape to the Entity and the RigidBody component makes the Entity be simulated by the physics engine.

You can change the default [gravity](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/designer/settings/#gravity) in the Scene Settings.
