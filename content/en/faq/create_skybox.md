## How do I create a skybox?

To create a skybox for your scene you first need to create a [Cubemap asset](http://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/assets/cubemaps/). Then you can drag and drop the Cubemap inside the 3D viewport, or you can go to the Scene Settings and drag the Cubemap in the Skybox field.
