## How do I change the color of a model?

<img src="https://playcanvas.com/static-assets/instructions/change_material.gif"/>

Every surface on a 3D model is rendered using a **material**. The material defines the properties of that surface, such as its color, shininess, bumpiness etc.

You can create a new material and drag and drop it on your model or you can select its existing materials and edit their properties in the Inspector.
