## How do I create a material?

Every surface on a 3D model is rendered using a **material**. The material defines the properties of that surface, such as its color, shininess, bumpiness etc.

To create a material click on the **<span class="font-icon">&#57632;</span> Add** button in the Assets panel and then select **New Material**.
