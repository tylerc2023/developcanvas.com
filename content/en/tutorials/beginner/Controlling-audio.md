*Use Right and Left cursor keys to play and stop the sounds respectively.*
*Use the Down and Up cursor keys to pause and unpause a sound respectively.*
*The full code used is shown at the bottom of this page.*

In this tutorial we will show you how to play and control audio files in PlayCanvas. Note that there are more controllable features and properties (such as pitch control). See the [audio API listing here][1] for more details.

##The audio commands

The main audio commands to access the audiosource component of an entity and affect values are:

~~~javascript~~~
this.entity.audiosource.play("swooop_theme");

this.entity.audiosource.pause();

this.entity.audiosource.unpause();

this.entity.audiosource.stop();
~~~
In order, the lines of code above: play one audio file that has been attached to the audiosource component from the Designer, pause the audio file that is playing from the entity, unpause the audio file that was playing from the entity and stop audio playback.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
 Note that one audiosource component (and so one entity) can only play one attached audio file at a time. Utilise the entity hierarchy to build a range of entities at the required positions in 3D space in order to play multiple sounds from a single object with correct 3D audio representation. For example a parent 'human' entity with a range of child entities: one entity and audiosource component placed at a character's mouth for speech and one entity and audiosource at a character's feet to play footstep sounds.
</div>

##General setup
The audio file was uploaded in .mp3 format (.ogg files are also usable). A sphere was created, and an audiosource component attached. The audio file was then added to the assets list within the audiosource settings. The activate option in the audiosource settings was disabled so as not to play the file immediately on loading. An audiolistener component was added to the default camera. The [full Designer scene and scripts can be accessed here][2] in the 'controllingAudio' pack.

The full code used for the above PlayCanvas app is as follows:

~~~javascript~~~
pc.script.create('audioHandler', function (context) {
    // Creates a new AudioHandler instance
    var AudioHandler = function (entity) {
        this.entity = entity;
    };

    AudioHandler.prototype = {
        // Called once after all resources are loaded and before the first update
        initialize: function () {
            this.audio = context.root.findByName('AudioSphere');
            this.playing = false;
            this.paused = false;
            //this sets up an event listener
            context.keyboard.on(pc.EVENT_KEYDOWN, this.onKeyDown, this);
        },

        // Called every frame, dt is time in seconds since last update
        update: function (dt) {

             if (context.keyboard.wasPressed(pc.KEY_UP) && this.paused === true) {
                this.audio.audiosource.unpause();
                this.audio.setLocalScale(4, 4, 4);
                this.playing = true;
                this.paused = false;
            }

            if (context.keyboard.wasPressed(pc.KEY_DOWN) && this.playing === true) {
                this.audio.audiosource.pause();
                this.audio.setLocalScale(2, 2, 2);
                this.playing = false;
                this.paused = true;
            }

            if (context.keyboard.wasPressed(pc.KEY_RIGHT) && this.playing === false) {
                this.audio.audiosource.play("swooop_theme");
                this.audio.setLocalScale(4, 4, 4);
                this.playing = true;
            }

            if (context.keyboard.wasPressed(pc.KEY_LEFT)) {
                this.audio.audiosource.stop();
                this.audio.setLocalScale(2, 2, 2);
                this.playing = false;
                this.paused = false;
            }
        },
        // This function is simply to prevent default browser actions such as scrolling when cursor keys are pressed
        onKeyDown: function (event) {
            event.event.preventDefault();
        }
    };

    return AudioHandler;
});
