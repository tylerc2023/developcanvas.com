Our Starter Kits are a great way to learn how to develop games with PlayCanvas. Or if you're already familiar with our features, you can use them to get a head start and build your app quickly.

The documentation for each of these Starter Kits contains a full explanation of the code and assets provided. Plus a set of challenges and exercises for you to try, which will extend and enhance the starter kit and teach you new skills in PlayCanvas.

To create an project using a starter kit use the Create Project button on your dashboard as usual. In the dialog where you choose the name of your new project there is a drop-down menu to choose your starter kit. Select the starter kit you wish to use (or none if you want an empty project).

See the individual Starter Kit's page for more details.
