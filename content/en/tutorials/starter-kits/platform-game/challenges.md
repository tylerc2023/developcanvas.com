Once you've mastered how the platform game starter kit works you can extend it with more features and fancier graphics.

We've compiled a selection of basic, intermediate and advanced features that you could implement as extensions to the basic starter kit.

If you implement any of these features, be sure to post it to the forum and we'll include the best answers here.

# Challenges

## Basic

* Create a new level
* Improve the enemy script so that it can move between neighbouring platforms

##Â Intermediate

* Make the moving platforms "sticky"

## Advanced

* Add a dive bomb attack for Playbot which kills Punch
