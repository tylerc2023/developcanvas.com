# Getting Started

The [User Manual][1] is our complete guide to PlayCanvas. It will help you to use the many features of the platform including the [Editor][13], [Scripting system][14] and [Version Control][15].

We have a [growing section][23] of more tutorials and code samples to learn and use. Don't see one that you need? Ask away on our [forums][10]!
