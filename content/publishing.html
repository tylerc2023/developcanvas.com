# Publishing Your PlayCanvas App

Once you have built your web app, you will no doubt want to publish out to the web and allow people to enjoy its majesty! PlayCanvas makes things very easy for you. You have a choice in how you do this:

1. **Export** your web app to a ZIP file which can be downloaded and then extracted to the web server of your choosing.
2. **Publish** your web app to `http://apps.playcanvas.com/`.

Let's take each of these in turn.

## Publishing on playcanvas.com

The fastest, easiest, most convenient way to publish your game is to make it live on playcanvas.com. To publish in this way, follow these steps:

* In your project dashboard, select the 'Designer' tab.
* Check the pack that you want to export.
* Click the 'Export' button at the top right of the pack lister.
* Select the 'Exports' tab. You should see your exported pack. The generation of the export may not be complete when you view the Exports page. After all, the server has to do some work to generate your download for you. If the download link has not yet appeared, refresh the page until it is visible.
* Check the newly exported pack.
* Click the 'Publish' button at the top right of the exports lister.
* A dialog will ask you for a name for the published app. This is used to construct the URL in the form `http://apps.playcanvas.com/<PLAYCANVAS_USERNAME>/<DEPOT_NAME>/<PUBLISH_NAME>`. So for example, if PlayCanvas user 'will' had a project called 'callofhonor' and chose a publish name of 'megawar', the published URL would be `http://apps.playcanvas.com/will/callofhonor/megawar`. Enter a name and click 'OK'.
* Your web app is now live! Feel free to tweet it and share to Facebook right from the published URL.

## Self-Hosting your PlayCanvas Game

If you don't want to host your web app on `playcanvas.com`, then you are free to download it in its entirety and place it wherever you like. To do this, follow these steps:

* In your project dashboard, select the 'Packs' tab.
* Check the pack that you want to export.
* Click the 'Export' button at the top right of the pack lister.
* Select the 'Exports' tab. You should see your exported pack. The generation of the export may not be complete when you view the Exports page. After all, the server has to do some work to generate your download for you. If the download link has not yet appeared, refresh the page until it is visible.
* Click download and your ZIP will be downloaded to your hard drive.
* Extract the contents wherever you like and point a browser at the contained index.html. You PlayCanvas web app will load.
