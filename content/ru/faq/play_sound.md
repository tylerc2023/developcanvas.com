## How do I play a sound?

To play sounds you need to add a <a href="http://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/packs/components/sound/" target="_blank">Sound</a> component to an Entity. Then you can create slots to play <a href="http://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/assets/audio/" target="_blank">Audio assets</a>. Simply click "Add Slot" and drag an Audio Asset on the Asset field. In order to hear the sounds you also need to add an <a href="http://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/packs/components/audiolistener/" target="_blank">AudioListener</a> component to an Entity - usually to the Camera Entity.

You can create Audio assets by dragging audio files from your computer into the Assets panel.
