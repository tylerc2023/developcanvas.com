Audio assets are sound files which can be played back using the [Sound component][sound-component].

Any audio format that is supported by the web-browser is supported by PlayCanvas. No processing is done to the audio file on import.

Note that not all formats are supported in all browsers. Currently, the most widely supported format is [MP3][mp3].
