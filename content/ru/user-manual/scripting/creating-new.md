## Attaching a script to an Entity

<img src="/images/user-manual/components/component-script.jpg" style="width: 300px; float: right; padding: 20px; padding-top: 0px;"/>

Script Components are attached to Entities in the same way as all other Components using the *Add Component* button in the Entity inspector.

Once you have added a Script Component you can specify which javascript files to load. Use the Add Script button to pick scripts from your asset panel. Or drag and drop a script from the asset panel onto the component.

If you are using the PlayCanvas code repository to store your code, you can edit code in the PlayCanvas code editor, click a script's name below the URL input box.

<div class="alert alert-info">
If you are using Github or Bitbucket you can not edit you scripts in PlayCanvas, you must make your commits through your source control system.
</div>

A script component can load multiple script files, just add multiple scripts to the component. The order in which you add your scripts on a Script Component is the order in which the scripts are going to be initialized and updated. If you want to change the order of a script, click on the Up - Down arrows next to the Script's title. To remove a script click on the X button.
