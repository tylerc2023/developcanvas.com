The hue-saturation effect allows you to modify the hue and saturation of the rendered image.

Here is an image without the effect:

<img alt="Image without effect" src="/images/platform/posteffects/without_effects.png"></img>

and the same image with the effect applied and changes to hue and saturation:

<img alt="Image with effect" src="/images/platform/posteffects/with_hue_saturation.png"></img>

The built-in hue-saturation effect has the following attributes:
* **Hue**: The hue of the image. Ranges from -1 to 1 (-1 is 180 degrees in the negative direction, 0 no change, 1 is 180 degrees in the positive direction).
* **Saturation**: The saturation of the image. Ranges from -1 to 1 (-1 is solid gray, 0 no change, 1 maximum saturation).
