# Basic Keyboard Input

*Click to focus, then press `left arrow` and `right arrow` to speed up and slow down rotation, press and hold `spacebar` to change the color*

Keyboard handling in the PlayCanvas engine is provided by the `pc.input.Keyboard` object. The Keyboard object provides a simple interface
for common keyboard operations like checking if a key is pressed or held down. It also takes away the various cross-browser problems with 
handling keycodes and charcodes. 

Take a look at the input_keyboard Pack in the [tutorials depot][depot]. Here is the code for the tutorial:

~~~javascript~~~
pc.script.create("keyboard_handler", function (context) {

    var KeyboardHandler = function (entity) {
        this.entity = entity;
        this.spinRate = 0;
    };

    KeyboardHandler.prototype = {
        update: function (dt) {
            /*
             * Notice in the demo that pressing and holding the arrow keys doesn't 
             * make the block spin faster. wasPressed() is used to detect a 
             * keypress that occurred since the last frame and will only be 
             * called once even if the key is held down.
             */
            if (context.keyboard.wasPressed(pc.input.KEY_LEFT)) {
                this.spinRate -= 0.5;
            } else if (context.keyboard.wasPressed(pc.input.KEY_RIGHT)) {
                this.spinRate += 0.5;            
            } 

            /*
             * Notice that pressing and holding the space bar makes the block 
             * continuously change color. isPressed() is used to detected if a
             * key is down right now. So it will be true every frame as long as 
             * the key is still pressed.
             */
            if (context.keyboard.isPressed(pc.input.KEY_SPACE)) {
                var color = context.systems.primitive.get(this.entity, "color");
                color -= 0xff;
                context.systems.primitive.set(this.entity, "color", color);
            }

            // Update the spinning cube
            if (this.spinRate !== 0) {
                this.entity.rotateLocal(0, this.spinRate, 0);
            }
        }
    };
    
    return KeyboardHandler;
});

The two `if` statements in the main update loop demonstrate the different methods to testing for key presses.

### `isPressed(key)`

`isPressed(key)` checks to see if `key` is currently pressed and returns true if it is. It will return true for every frame while the key is pressed.

### `wasPressed(key)`

`wasPressed(key)` checks to see if `key` was pressed *since the last frame*. `wasPressed()` will only return true once for a single key press.

### Try it out

Try it out in full screen [here][tutorial] or at the top of the page. Compare tapping and holding the arrow keys, and tapping and holding the spacebar.
