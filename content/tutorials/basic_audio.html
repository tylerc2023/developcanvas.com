# Basic Audio

## Sources and Listeners

In this tutorial we will place two AudioSources in the scene, and attach and AudioListener to the main camera. By moving the listener closer and further from the two sources we will hear the sound panning from left to right and getting louder and quieter as we move.

The basic audio system in PlayCanvas centres on two Component types. The AudioSource Component plays an audio asset like a wave, MP3 or ogg vorbis file. Imagine AudioSource Components like loudspeakers in the scene. There can be many active AudioSources, each playing a single sound. The AudioListener Component determines how an AudioSource is heard. Imagine AudioListener Components like a microphone in the scene. There can only be one active AudioListener at a time.

## Creating Sources and Listeners

To create an AudioSource select the Entity you wish to add the source to and choose *New Component* from the *Entity* menu. Select *audiosource* from the list of Components and press the *Add* button.

AudioSource properties will now appear in the AttributeEditor
