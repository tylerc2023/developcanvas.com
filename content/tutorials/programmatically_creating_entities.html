# Programmatically Creating Entities
<iframe src="http://apps.playcanvas.com/dave/tutorials/creating_entities?overlay=false" ></iframe>

Usually you will be creating Entities via the PlayCanvas Designer, building up collections of Components and scripts to create the various parts of your game. However, in some cases it is convenient to create Entities in your scripts. This tutorial shows you how.


## Creating a Entity

~~~js~~~
// Create a new Entity
var entity = new pc.fw.Entity();

// Add it to the Entity hierarchy
context.root.addChild(entity);
~~~~~~~~

First you need to create an Entity. This is straightforward, but it is important to add the Entity to the main Entity hierarchy. Only Entities in the hierarchy will have their transforms, Components and scripts updated. In your scripts you can access the root of the Entity hierarchy from the `ApplicationContext` object which is passed into your script. By convention this is usually named `context` and the hierarchy root is available as `context.root`.

## Adding Components

~~~js~~~
// Create a new Entity
var entity = new pc.fw.Entity();

// Create a new Camera Component with default values
context.systems.camera.createComponent(entity);

// Create a new Primitive Component and add it to the Entity.
context.systems.primitive.createComponent(entity, {
    type: 'Box',
    color: '0xff0000',
});

// Add it to the Entity hierarchy
context.root.addChild(entity);
~~~~~~~~

An Entity on it's own doesn't do much, so you will need to add Components in order to add functionality to your Entity. Each `ComponentSystem` provides  a `createComponent(entity, data)` method which takes the Entity and a data object as arguments. 

Each Component type has different properties that can be passed in on the data object, see the Component's documentation for more detail about which properties are available *(coming soon)*. The `data` argument can be left out and default values will be used.

## Removing Components

~~~js~~~
var entity = new pc.fw.Entity();

// Attach Camera Component with default values
context.systems.camera.createComponent(entity);

// Delete the Camera Component
context.systems.camera.deleteComponent(entity);
~~~~~~~~

Components can be deleted individually from an Entity by calling the `deleteComponent` method on the `ComponentSystem`.

## Deleting Entities

~~~js~~~
// Create a new Entity
var entity = new pc.fw.Entity();

// Create a new Camera Component with default values
context.systems.camera.createComponent(entity);

// Create a new Primitive Component and add it to the Entity.
context.systems.primitive.createComponent(entity, {
    type: 'Box',
    color: '0xff0000',
});

// Add it to the Entity hierarchy
context.root.addChild(entity);

// Delete the Entity and remove it from the hierarchy
entity.close(context.systems);
~~~~~~~~

When you are finished with an Entity you call the `close` method on the Entity. This will delete all Components and remove the Entity from the hierarchy. It will also delete all child Entities in the same way. The close method take the `ComponentRegistry` as an argument. In your scripts this is available as the `context.systems` variable.
