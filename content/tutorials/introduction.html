# Introduction

Welcome to the PlayCanvas tutorials. You'll find a selection of short articles designed to cover single tasks that will help you on your way to making a game with the PlayCanvas platform. They are designed such that you can work your way through them, learning bit by bit, or if you are trying to accomplish something specific you can find a tutorial which should walk you through your problem, or at least get you started on the right track.

## Common Starting Point

In order to prevent repeating ourselves, the tutorials will all from a common place. A new pack in the Depot called *tutorials*.

### Create the *tutorials* depot

To create a new depot navigate to your profile page, e.g. for user 'dave' the profile page is:

~~~sh~~~
http://platform.playcanvas.com/dave/
~~~~~~~~

This [link][profile] should take you to your profile. 

You will see your user profile details and a list of all your depots (if you have any). Click on the **add new** link to create a new depot. Fill in the form using the name "tutorials", the name field is the only one that is required, you can fill in the rest, or update them later.

After you have clicked the create button you will be returned to your profile page and see the new depot in your depot list. Click on the word **tutorials** to take you to the depot dashboard.

The depot dashboard is where you update the contents and settings of your depot. There are six areas:

**Packs** - The Packs area lists all the Pack Entities you've created in this depot, and allows you to create new ones, edit, delete or export existing ones.

**Assets**  - Assets are external resources such as 3D models, textures and audio files that your application references. Assets must be uploaded into a depot in order for them to be accessed by your Entities.

**Exports** - Once you are done creating your game, you will want to export it. This creates a single bundle that you can either download and host on your own website, or publish to the PlayCanvas platform.

**Apps** - Apps are the result of the publishing and export to the PlayCanvas platform. In the Apps section you can view, edit or delete apps that you have published.

**Code** - The Code area is used to set up a Code Repository to sync your game scripts. 

**Settings** - In the Settings area you can edit depot settings, including adding collaborators who can access your depot.

### Create a new pack

To create a new pack, make sure you are in the Pack area of the depot dashboard by clicking on the pack tab, then click on the **New Pack** button at the bottom of the list. You will launch the PlayCanvas Designer application in a new tab. In the dialog that appears type the name that you wish to use for your Pack (this is also the name of the root Entity in the pack), and click the **OK** button.

## Summary

Before you start the tutorials you should create a depot to store all the tutorials packs you create in. For most of the tutorials it is helpful to create a new pack named after the tutorial you are doing and start from there.
