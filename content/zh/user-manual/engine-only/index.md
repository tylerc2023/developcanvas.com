The vast majority of PlayCanvas developers build applications with the Editor. But it is also possible to build applications using just the PlayCanvas Engine, the open source JavaScript runtime which powers all PlayCanvas apps.

To get started with the engine, visit the [GitHub repository][1].

The repo contains many [examples][2] that demonstrate the wide variety of engine features.
