## How do I create a cubemap?

Cubemaps are a special type of texture asset. They are formed from 6 texture assets where each texture represents the face of a cube.

To create a cubemap click on the **<span class="font-icon">&#57632;</span> Add** button in the Assets panel and select **New Cubemap**. Then drag 6 textures in the cubemap inspector. To take advantage of Physically Based Rendering make sure you click **Prefilter** after setting the 6 textures.
