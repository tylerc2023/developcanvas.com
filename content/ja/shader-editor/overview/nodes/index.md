Shader Editor supports many types of nodes, but they all have the following structure:

![Graph Editor Node][1]

| Node structure | |
|---|---|
| 1 | Node type. |
| 2 | Input Ports. |
| 3 | Output Ports. |

Certain nodes have no input ports and others have no output ports. (Though all nodes have at least one port).

### Node Categories

Based on this, we can identify three categories of nodes:

- Input nodes - these have output ports, but no input ports.
- Output nodes - these have input ports, but no output ports.
- Transform nodes - these have both input ports and output ports.
