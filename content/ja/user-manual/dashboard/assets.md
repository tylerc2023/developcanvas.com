![Dashboard][2]

The Asset dashboard lists all the Assets that are in your Project.

## Source Assets and Target Assets

By default only Source Assets are shown in dashboard. You can use the filter to show and hide Target Assets too.

When you delete a Source Asset, all Target Assets created from the Source Asset will be deleted as well.

There is full explanation about the difference between Source and Target assets in [this section][1]
