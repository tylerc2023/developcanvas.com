Components define behaviours that are attached to Entities. An Entity is a container for Components.

There are many different Components defined in the PlayCanvas Engine. You can add a Component to an Entity using the PlayCanvas Editor. The properties exposed by Components are listed in the Attribute Editor when you select an Entity.
