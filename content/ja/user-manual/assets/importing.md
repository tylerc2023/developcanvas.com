## Creating New Assets

To upload an asset to PlayCanvas, follow these steps:

### In the Editor

* Drag and drop your asset file into the Asset panel in the Editor window.
* A progress bar will appear along the bottom.
* When the progress bar disappears, your new Asset will appear in the Asset panel.

Now, when you attempt to choose an asset via the asset picker attribute control (for the Model component or the Animation component for example), your asset will be available for assignment.

## Updating Existing Assets

To update an Asset that you have already uploaded. Upload the asset again, ensuring that you have the same filename as the existing asset. PlayCanvas will update the existing asset with the new upload.
