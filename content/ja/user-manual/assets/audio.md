Audio assets are sound files which can be played back using the Audiosource component.

Any audio format that is supported by the web-browser is supported by PlayCanvas. No processing is done to the audio file on import.

Note: not all formats are supported in all browsers. As of writing the most widely supported format is MP3 although Firefox requires OS level support for MP3 playback in order for this format to work.
