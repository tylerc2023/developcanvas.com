# Scripting Workflow

There are two ways for you to run your application scripts while developing PlayCanvas applications. While developing and iterating you will use a Local Server for your code and in order to share and publish you will use a Code Repository. Each have different advantages and you will often switch between the two.

## Local Server

Whilst developing your game you want quick iteration times. Your script files reside on your local computer and you edit them there. By running a tiny web server on your local machine any changes you make to your scripts will be instantly incorporated into the application by simply refreshing the browser.

The web server is simple to run, you drop the launch script in the folder where your code lives on your computer, and then start the server. 
Installing and setting up the local server is slightly different for each platform.

### Windows

* First you will need to install python from [here][python]. By default `localserver.bat` uses Python 2.7, but you can modify it to run with any recent version.

* [Download the server script][server_windows]

* Save the file `localserver.bat` into the folder containing your scripts. 

* Double click the server to run it. You should see a terminal prompt wth a message something like this:
~~~sh~~~
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 51000 ...
~~~~~~~~

### OS X and Linux

* [Download the server script][server_osx_linux]

* Save the file `localserver` into the folder containing your scripts

* Make the server executable. At the command line type
~~~sh~~~
chmod a+x /path/to/scripts/localserver
~~~~~~~~

* Now you can double-click the localserver file to start your server. You should see a terminal prompt with a message something like this:
~~~sh~~~
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 51000 ...
~~~~~~~~

### Running applications against the local server

Once you have started your local server you can see test your server is running correctly by visiting `http://localhost:51000` in your web browser. 
You will see a directory of files. Like this:

![served directory](/media/images/platform/localserver.png "Local server directory")

Launching packs from the PlayCanvas Designer using the `Launch Local` command will start the application looking for scripts on `http://localhost:51000` which means if you are running your local server the browser loads scripts from your machine. If you have a code repository set up for your depot -- see the next section -- you can run using the regular `Launch` command and scripts will be served entirely from your code repository.

## Code Repository

Whilst running the local server is nice and simple, it is not really necessary for people on your team who aren't going to be editing the code, like the artists
and production staff. In addition, if you want to publish or export your application into a releasable format your script code needs to be somewhere that is
accessible to the PlayCanvas servers so that it can be included in any exported package. 

For these scenarios we provide support for external code repositories. That is, a connection between your source control system and our servers.

![code repository](/media/images/platform/code_repo.png "Code Repository")

In order to add a repository to your depot, go to your depot's code page; enter the url where the source code for your application can be found; check the Enabled
box and press Update.

Behind the scenes PlayCanvas will clone or sync a copy of your code and hold it on our servers. The status of this syncing operation is displayed on the code page.
The green light means you're ready to go.

Now when you run your application from the PlayCanvas Designer the code will be included in the application as it is run. Which means you don't need to be running a local server. Also when you export Packs which have a 
code repository set up the code will be included in your exports.

### Note

Code Repositories are only updated when you press the Update button on the code settings page.

Currently we only support public, Mercurial repositories hosted on Bitbucket. Support for private repositories, 
plus Github and other source control systems is coming soon.

## Switching 

You can easily switch between using local code and a code repository when using the PlayCanvas Designer by choosing which Launch button to use.

![Launch Buttons][launch_buttons]

**Launch** (on the left) will launch using your code repostiory, **Launch Local** (on the right) will launch against a locally running server*

Exporting packs will only use the code repository for source code resources.
