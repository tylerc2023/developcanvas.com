## How do I play an animation?

To play an animation of a 3D model you need to create an Entity with a [Model Component](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/packs/components/model/) and an [Animation Component](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/packs/components/animation/). The **Model Component** will render your model and the **Animation Component** will play animations.

To render the model drag a model Asset in the Asset field of the Model Component. To play animations drag Animation Assets on the Assets field of the Animation Component.
