## How do I play a sound?

To play sounds you need to add a [Sound component](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/packs/components/sound/) to an Entity. Then you can create slots to play [Audio assets](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/assets/audio/). Simply click "Add Slot" and drag an Audio Asset on the Asset field. In order to hear the sounds you also need to add an [AudioListener component](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/user-manual/packs/components/audiolistener/) to an Entity - usually to the Camera Entity.

You can create Audio assets by dragging audio files from your computer into the Assets panel.
